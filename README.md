### Hi there 👋

#### As a business professional, I enjoyed worked with data and so I decided to pursue a Master's in Management Analytics (MMA) which exposed me to statistical analysis, advanced analytics and Big Data. As I try to build my analytics career, I'll be showcasing some of my work. Enjoy! :)
