### Hi there! 👋

As a business professional, I enjoyed worked with data and analyzing trends which led me to pursue a Master's degree in Management Analytics (MMA). This exposed me to a lot of cool things such as advanced analytics and Big Data. As I try to build my analytics career, I'll be showcasing some of my work here. Enjoy! :)
